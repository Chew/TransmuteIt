# TransmuteIt

Welcome to TransmuteIt, my 2nd plugin!

## Lore
This plugin is inspired by ProjectE's transmutation tablet. I'm a big fan of the EMC system, and how you actually need to transmute the item to be able to transmute more of it. This is essentially just the tablet. No stone or anything. You can customize each EMC value and all that.

The design is to mimic it as much as possible, as a result:

1) You need to transmute an item to be able to transmute it.

## Planned

I have a lot planned that are probably way over my head in ability to actually do them. [This Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/SZVMEvD7/transmuteit) will hopefully help me with it.
